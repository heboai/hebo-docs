### Configuration

You can configure Hebo Eval in two ways:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   export HEBO_AGENT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Configuration File**:
   Create a JSON configuration file (e.g., `config.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "embedding": {
       "provider": "hebo",
       "model": "hebo-embedding",
       "apiKey": "your_hebo_embeddings_key",
     },
     "agent": {
       "agentKey": "your_hebo_agent_key",
       "provider": "hebo"
     }
   }
   ```

### Test Cases

Hebo Eval supports a flexible test case structure that allows you to organize and manage your test cases effectively.

#### Test Case Structure

1. **Multiple Test Cases in One File**:
   - Test cases can be defined in a single file, separated by `---`
   - Each test case starts with a title using `# Test Case Name` format

2. **Directory Organization**:
   - Test cases can be organized in subdirectories
   - All test cases in subdirectories are automatically discovered and executed

#### Test Case Format

```text
# Basic Conversation Test
System: You are a helpful assistant that specializes in customer service.
User: Hi there!
Assistant: Hello! How can I assist you today?

---
# Weather Query Test
System: You are a weather assistant that provides detailed weather information.
User: Could you check the current weather in New York for me?
Assistant: It's rainy in New York today with a temperature of 59Â°F. There's an 80% chance of rain, high humidity (96%), and a light breeze at 2 mph. You might want to bring an umbrella!
```

#### Special Characters and Multiline Messages

When writing test cases, it's important to understand how to handle special characters and multiline messages correctly. Here's a comprehensive guide:

#### Special Characters

The following characters have special meaning in test cases:

| Character | Usage | Example |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `:` | Role marker delimiter | `user:`, `assistant:`, `system:` |
| `#` | Test case title | `# My Test Case` |
| `---` | Test case separator | Used between test cases |

#### Escaping Special Characters

To include literal special characters in your messages, you can use them directly in the message content. The parser will only interpret these characters as special when they appear in specific contexts:

- `:` is only special when it appears after a role marker
- `#` is only special when it appears at the start of a line
- `---` is only special when it appears on its own line

Examples:
```text
# Special Characters Example
user: The price is $10:50
assistant: That's correct! The colon (:) is just part of the price.

user: Here's a markdown heading: # Important Note
assistant: The # symbol is just part of the text here.

user: The separator looks like this: ---
assistant: Yes, that's just three hyphens in the text.
```

#### Multiline Message Format

Hebo Eval supports two styles of multiline messages:

1. **Indented Style**:
   ```text
   user: This is a multiline message
         that continues on the next line
         with proper indentation
   ```

2. **Non-indented Style**:
   ```text
   user: This is another multiline message
   that continues on the next line
   without indentation
   ```

Both styles are valid and will be parsed correctly. Choose the style that best fits your needs.

#### Code Examples with Multiline Messages

Here are some common scenarios:

1. **Basic Conversation with Multiline**:
   ````markdown
   user: Please explain how to use a for loop
         in JavaScript with an example.

   assistant: Here's how to use a for loop in JavaScript:
   ```JavaScript
   for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
     console.log(i);
   }
   ```

   This loop will print numbers 0 to 4.
   ````

2. **System Message with Configuration**:
   ```text
   system: You are a helpful assistant.
          You should always be polite and professional.
          You can use tools when necessary.

   user: Hello!

   assistant: Hi there! How can I help you today?
   ```

3. **Complex Code Review**:
   ````markdown
   user: Can you review this code?
   
   ```JavaScript
   function calculateTotal(items) {
     let total = 0;
     for (let item of items) {
       total += item.price;
     }
     return total;
   }
   ```
   assistant: Here's my review of your code:

   1. The function is well-structured and clear
   2. Consider adding input validation
   3. You might want to handle edge cases
   ````

#### Best Practices for Multiline Messages

1. Be consistent with your chosen style (indented or non-indented)
2. Use proper indentation when including code blocks
3. Keep messages readable and well-formatted
4. Use empty lines to separate different parts of a message when needed
5. When including code, use appropriate code block formatting

#### Markdown Test Cases

Hebo Eval supports test cases written in markdown format, which is particularly useful for code review and technical discussions. Markdown test cases support:

- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Lists and formatting
- Multi-turn conversations with code examples
- Detailed explanations and responses

Example of a markdown test case:

````markdown
# Simple Code Example

user: Can you show me how to write a function that doubles a number?

assistant: Here's a simple function that doubles a number:
```JavaScript
function double(n: number): number {
  return n * 2;
}
```

This function takes a number as input and returns its double. For example, `double(5)` returns `10`.

````markdown
# Code Review Test Case

user: Can you review this code snippet and suggest improvements?

```typescript
function calculateTotal(items: Item[]): number {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    total += items[i].price;
  }
  return total;
}
```

assistant: I'll review the code and suggest some improvements.

Here are my observations and recommendations:

1. **Performance Optimization**

   - The current implementation uses a traditional for loop
   - We can use `reduce()` for a more functional approach
   - This would make the code more concise and readable

2. **Type Safety**

   - The `Item` type is used but not defined
   - We should ensure proper type definitions

3. **Error Handling**
   - No validation for empty arrays
   - No handling for null/undefined items

Here's my suggested improvement:

```typescript
interface Item {
  price: number;
  // Add other properties as needed
}

function calculateTotal(items: Item[]): number {
  if (!items?.length) return 0;

  return items.reduce((total, item) => {
    if (typeof item.price !== 'number') {
      throw new Error('Invalid item price');
    }
    return total + item.price;
  }, 0);
}
```

The improvements include:

- **Null Check**: Added validation for empty arrays
- **Type Safety**: Added `Item` interface
- **Error Handling**: Added price validation
- **Modern Syntax**: Used `reduce()` instead of for loop
- **Readability**: Better code organization

Would you like me to explain any of these improvements in more detail?

user: Yes, please explain why using `reduce()` is better than a for loop in this case.

assistant: Let me explain the benefits of using `reduce()` over a traditional for loop:

1. **Functional Programming Benefits**

   - `reduce()` is a pure function that doesn't modify external state
   - It makes the code's intent clearer - we're reducing an array to a single value
   - It's more declarative than imperative

2. **Code Safety**

   - `reduce()` handles array bounds automatically
   - No risk of off-by-one errors
   - No need to manage loop counter variables

3. **Maintainability**
   - The code is more concise and easier to read
   - Less chance of introducing bugs when modifying the code
   - Easier to test and reason about

Here's a comparison:

```typescript
// Traditional for loop
let total = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
  total += items[i].price;
}

// Using reduce()
const total = items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
```

The `reduce()` version:

- Is more concise (1 line vs 4 lines)
- Doesn't require a mutable variable
- Clearly shows we're accumulating a sum
- Is less prone to errors

Would you like me to show you how to add unit tests for this function?

user: Yes, that would be helpful.

assistant: I'll show you how to write comprehensive unit tests for the `calculateTotal` function.

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';

describe('calculateTotal', () => {
  it('should return 0 for empty array', () => {
    expect(calculateTotal([])).toBe(0);
  });

  it('should calculate total for valid items', () => {
    const items = [{ price: 10 }, { price: 20 }, { price: 30 }];
    expect(calculateTotal(items)).toBe(60);
  });

  it('should throw error for invalid price', () => {
    const items = [{ price: 10 }, { price: 'invalid' as any }, { price: 30 }];
    expect(() => calculateTotal(items)).toThrow('Invalid item price');
  });

  it('should handle null/undefined items', () => {
    expect(calculateTotal(null as any)).toBe(0);
    expect(calculateTotal(undefined as any)).toBe(0);
  });
});
```

Key test cases covered:

1. **Empty Array**: Verifies correct handling of empty input
2. **Valid Items**: Tests basic functionality with valid data
3. **Invalid Price**: Ensures proper error handling
4. **Null/Undefined**: Tests edge cases

The tests follow these best practices:

- Clear test descriptions
- Isolated test cases
- Edge case coverage
- Error handling verification

Would you like me to explain any of these test cases in more detail?
