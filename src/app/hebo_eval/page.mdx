## Hebo Eval CLI

Hebo Eval is a powerful command-line tool for evaluating and testing language models. It provides a robust framework for running evaluations against your AI agents and generating detailed reports.

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g hebo-eval
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
hebo-eval run <agent> [options]
```

### Command Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-d, --directory <path>` | Directory containing test cases | `./examples` |
| `-c, --config <path>` | Path to configuration file | - |
| `-t, --threshold <number>` | Score threshold for passing (0-1) | `0.8` |
| `-f, --format <format>` | Output format (json\|markdown\|text) | `text` |
| `-s, --stop-on-error` | Stop processing on first error | `false` |
| `-m, --max-concurrency <number>` | Maximum number of concurrent test executions | `5` |

### Configuration

You can configure Hebo Eval in two ways:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   export HEBO_AGENT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   export HEBO_AGENT_PROVIDER=provider
   ```

2. **Configuration File**:
   Create a JSON configuration file (e.g., `config.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "embedding": {
       "provider": "hebo",
       "model": "hebo-embedding",
       "apiKey": "your_hebo_embeddings_key",
     },
     "agent": {
       "agentKey": "your_hebo_agent_key",
       "provider":"hebo",
     }
   }
   ```

### Test cases

By default hebo-eval will evaluate your agent on pre-writtern test cases provided with hebo-eval

To use your own test cases follow these instructions:

1. Create a directory for your test cases.

2. Write your test cases as ```.txt``` files

3. In the test case itself you can use the following format:

```filename="example.txt"
User: Hi there!
Assistant: Hello! How can I assist you today?

User: Could you check the current weather in New York for me?
Assistant: Of course! Let me look that up for you.

It’s rainy in New York today with a temperature of 59°F. There’s an 80% chance of rain, high humidity (96%), and a light breeze at 2 mph. You might want to bring an umbrella!

User: Can you simplify that for me?
Assistant: Sure! It’s rainy and cool (59°F) in New York right now. Expect wet weather and a light breeze.
```



### Example Usage

1. **Basic Evaluation**:
   ```bash
   hebo-eval run gato-qa:v1
   ```

2. **Custom Directory and Format**:
   ```bash
   hebo-eval run gato-qa:v1 -d ./my-tests -f markdown
   ```

3. **With Configuration File**:
   ```bash
   hebo-eval run gato-qa:v1 -c ./config.json
   ```

4. **Custom Threshold and Concurrency**:
   ```bash
   hebo-eval run gato-qa:v1 -t 0.5 -m 10
   ```

### Output Formats

The tool supports three output formats:

- `text`: Human-readable text format
- `markdown`: Markdown formatted report
- `json`: JSON structured data

### Error Handling

- The tool will automatically log any errors that occur during evaluation
- Use `--stop-on-error` to halt execution on the first error
- Failed test cases are clearly marked in the output

### Best Practices

1. Always set up your API keys before running evaluations
2. Start with a small test set before running large evaluations
3. Always ensure your custom test cases end with ```user:``` followed by an ```assistant:``` response as the assistant will be used as the reference answer to the test case.
4. Keep your configuration file secure and never commit it to version control

### Troubleshooting

To enable debug mode, use the `--verbose` flag.

Example usage:


If you encounter the "HEBO_API_KEY is required" error:

1. Verify your environment variables:
   ```bash
   export HEBO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. Or use a configuration file:
   ```bash
   hebo-eval run <agent> --config path/to/config.json
   ```
