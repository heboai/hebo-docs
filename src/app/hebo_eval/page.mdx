## Hebo Eval CLI

Hebo Eval is a powerful command-line tool for evaluating and testing language models. It provides a robust framework for running evaluations against your AI agents and generating detailed reports.

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g hebo-eval@latest
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
hebo-eval run <agent> [options]
```

### Command Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-d, --directory <path>` | Directory containing test cases | `./examples` |
| `-c, --config <path>` | Path to configuration file | - |
| `-t, --threshold <number>` | Score threshold for passing (0-1) | `0.8` |
| `-f, --format <format>` | Output format (json\|markdown\|text) | `text` |
| `-s, --stop-on-error` | Stop processing on first error | `false` |
| `-m, --max-concurrency <number>` | Maximum number of concurrent test executions | `5` |
| `--verbose` | Show detailed output for all test cases | `false` |

### Configuration

You can configure Hebo Eval in two ways:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   export HEBO_AGENT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Configuration File**:
   Create a JSON configuration file (e.g., `config.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "embedding": {
       "provider": "hebo",
       "model": "hebo-embedding",
       "apiKey": "your_hebo_embeddings_key",
     },
     "agent": {
       "agentKey": "your_hebo_agent_key",
       "provider": "hebo"
     }
   }
   ```

### Test Cases

Hebo Eval supports a flexible test case structure that allows you to organize and manage your test cases effectively.

#### Test Case Structure

1. **Multiple Test Cases in One File**:
   - Test cases can be defined in a single file, separated by `---`
   - Each test case starts with a title using `# Test Case Name` format

2. **Directory Organization**:
   - Test cases can be organized in subdirectories
   - All test cases in subdirectories are automatically discovered and executed

#### Test Case Format

```text
# Basic Conversation Test
System: You are a helpful assistant that specializes in customer service.
User: Hi there!
Assistant: Hello! How can I assist you today?

---
# Weather Query Test
System: You are a weather assistant that provides detailed weather information.
User: Could you check the current weather in New York for me?
Assistant: It's rainy in New York today with a temperature of 59°F. There's an 80% chance of rain, high humidity (96%), and a light breeze at 2 mph. You might want to bring an umbrella!
```

#### Special Characters and Multiline Messages

When writing test cases, it's important to understand how to handle special characters and multiline messages correctly. Here's a comprehensive guide:

#### Special Characters

The following characters have special meaning in test cases:

| Character | Usage | Example |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `:` | Role marker delimiter | `user:`, `assistant:`, `system:` |
| `#` | Test case title | `# My Test Case` |
| `---` | Test case separator | Used between test cases |

#### Escaping Special Characters

To include literal special characters in your messages, you can use them directly in the message content. The parser will only interpret these characters as special when they appear in specific contexts:

- `:` is only special when it appears after a role marker
- `#` is only special when it appears at the start of a line
- `---` is only special when it appears on its own line

Examples:
```text
# Special Characters Example
user: The price is $10:50
assistant: That's correct! The colon (:) is just part of the price.

user: Here's a markdown heading: # Important Note
assistant: The # symbol is just part of the text here.

user: The separator looks like this: ---
assistant: Yes, that's just three hyphens in the text.
```

#### Multiline Message Format

Hebo Eval supports two styles of multiline messages:

1. **Indented Style**:
   ```text
   user: This is a multiline message
         that continues on the next line
         with proper indentation
   ```

2. **Non-indented Style**:
   ```text
   user: This is another multiline message
   that continues on the next line
   without indentation
   ```

Both styles are valid and will be parsed correctly. Choose the style that best fits your needs.

#### Code Examples with Multiline Messages

Here are some common scenarios:

1. **Basic Conversation with Multiline**:
   ```text
   user: Please explain how to use a for loop
         in JavaScript with an example.

   assistant: Here's how to use a for loop in JavaScript:

   for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
     console.log(i);
   }

   This loop will print numbers 0 to 4.
   ```

2. **System Message with Configuration**:
   ```text
   system: You are a helpful assistant.
          You should always be polite and professional.
          You can use tools when necessary.

   user: Hello!

   assistant: Hi there! How can I help you today?
   ```

3. **Complex Code Review**:
   ```text
   user: Can you review this code?
   
   function calculateTotal(items) {
     let total = 0;
     for (let item of items) {
       total += item.price;
     }
     return total;
   }

   assistant: Here's my review of your code:

   1. The function is well-structured and clear
   2. Consider adding input validation
   3. You might want to handle edge cases
   ```

#### Best Practices for Multiline Messages

1. Be consistent with your chosen style (indented or non-indented)
2. Use proper indentation when including code blocks
3. Keep messages readable and well-formatted
4. Use empty lines to separate different parts of a message when needed
5. When including code, use appropriate code block formatting

#### Markdown Test Cases

Hebo Eval supports test cases written in markdown format, which is particularly useful for code review and technical discussions. Markdown test cases support:

- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Lists and formatting
- Multi-turn conversations with code examples
- Detailed explanations and responses

Example of a markdown test case:

```markdown
# Simple Code Example

user: Can you show me how to write a function that doubles a number?


```function double(n: number): number {
  return n * 2;
}```


assistant: Here's a simple function that doubles a number:
```function double(n: number): number {
  return n * 2;
}```

This function takes a number as input and returns its double. For example, `double(5)` returns `10`.
```



#### Directory Structure Example

```
tests/
├── basic/
│   ├── conversations.txt
│   └── simple_queries.txt
├── advanced/
│   ├── tool_usage.txt
│   └── complex_scenarios.txt
└── main.txt
```

### Output Format

The tool supports three output formats with different verbosity levels:

### Example Usage

1. **Basic Evaluation**:
   ```bash
   hebo-eval run gato-qa:v1
   ```

2. **Custom Directory and Format**:
   ```bash
   hebo-eval run gato-qa:v1 -d ./my-tests -f markdown
   ```

3. **With Configuration File**:
   ```bash
   hebo-eval run gato-qa:v1 -c ./config.json
   ```

4. **Custom Threshold and Concurrency**:
   ```bash
   hebo-eval run gato-qa:v1 -t 0.5 -m 10
   ```

5. **Verbose Output**:
   ```bash
   hebo-eval run gato-qa:v1 --verbose
   ```

### Best Practices

1. Always set up your API keys before running evaluations
2. Start with a small test set before running large evaluations
3. Use descriptive test case titles with the `#` format
4. Organize test cases in subdirectories for better management
5. Keep your configuration file secure and never commit it to version control
6. Use the `--verbose` flag when debugging test failures

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter the "HEBO_API_KEY is required" error:

1. Verify your environment variables:
   ```bash
   export HEBO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. Or use a configuration file:
   ```bash
   hebo-eval run <agent> --config path/to/config.json
   ```
